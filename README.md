[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fmserajnik%2Fhydrusrv.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fmserajnik%2Fhydrusrv?ref=badge_shield)

> A small application for serving media managed with
> [hydrus server][hydrus-server] via API

hydrusrv is a small application based on [Express][express] that can serve
media managed with [hydrus server][hydrus-server] over a REST-like API. It
accesses the databases and files of hydrus server directly, therefore
circumventing its native access key authentication. Instead, hydrusrv provides
its own (simple) user handling and token-based authentication (stored in a
separate database).

The application is only intended as a way to to read and serve hydrus server
data, not as an alternative way to manage it. It therefore does not have any
features that require more than read access.

A [Vue][vue]-based Web client for hydrusrv called [hydrusrvue][hydrusrvue] is
also available.

## Install

The easiest way to install is via cloning this repository:

```zsh
user@local:~$ git clone https://github.com/mserajnik/hydrusrv.git
user@local:~$ cd hydrusrv
user@local:hydrusrv$ yarn
```

If you encounter any errors during installation, those are likely caused by
two packages hydrusrv uses that both utilize [node-gyp][node-gyp] to compile
their underlying libraries.

Please take a look at the following resources and contact the maintainers of
those packages directly if you cannnot resolve your issues:

+ [better-sqlite3][better-sqlite3]
+ [node-argon2][node-argon2]

### Dependencies

+ [hydrus server][hydrus-server] (installing and running the server is quite
  difficult and not recommended for people who have no prior experience with
  hydrus; see [here][hydrus-server-installation] for installation instructions)
+ [Node.js][node-js] (tested on `9.10.0`+)
+ [Yarn][yarn] (tested on `1.6.0`+)
+ [node-gyp][node-gyp] (likely required for Windows, hydrusrv seems to install
  fine without it being globally installed on macOS and Linux)

### Updating

If you have installed via cloning the repository, you can update via Git:

```zsh
user@local:hydrusrv$ git pull
user@local:hydrusrv$ yarn
user@local:hydrusrv$ yarn migrate
```

Always make sure to run `yarn` after updating to install any packages you might
be missing. `yarn migrate` updates your database with the latest changes.

hydrusrv follows [Semantic Versioning][semantic-versioning] and any breaking
changes that require additional attention will be released under a new major
version (e.g., `2.0.0`). Minor version updates (e.g., `1.1.0` or `1.2.0`) are
therefore always safe to simply install via the routine mentioned before.

When necessary, this section will be expanded with upgrade guides to new major
versions.

#### Upgrading from 2.x to 3.x

Upgrading from `2.x` to `3.x` can be done via `git pull && yarn`, but requires
some additional work and considerations.

First of all, the app database structure has changed, with the table `tokens`
having a new column `media_hash`. You need to either re-create your database
from the template or add this column to your existing database manually.

It is __strongly recommended__ to re-create the database by copying the
template and running migrations (`yarn migrate`). This will ensure that any
future changes will just require running migrations instead of making manual
adjustments or starting over with an empty database.

Second, accessing media files now requires media tokens that are generated
alongside authentication tokens and expire together with them. Such a media
token must be provided as a query parameter in the form `?token=<media token>`
for every media file request.

#### Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x

Upgrading from `1.x` to `2.x` can be done via `git pull && yarn` and requires
only a few setting changes and considerations.

The main difference between `2.x` and `1.x` is that `2.x` uses a temporary copy
of the hydrus server data in its own application database instead of directly
querying the hydrus server database on demand for increased performance and
better extensibility.

The setting `HYDRUS_RESULTS_PER_PAGE` has therefore been renamed to just
`RESULTS_PER_PAGE` while a new setting called `DATA_UPDATE_INTERVAL` controls
how often hydrusrv should sync the temporary data with hydrus server (after the
initial sync when it starts).

This change now allows for sorting by an arbitrary number of namespaces instead
of just one while at the same time no longer limiting the result set by the
provided sort namespaces (which was an unfortunate side effect that was
unavoidable in `1.x` without killing the performance).

## Usage

### Configuration

After installing, the first thing you want to do is duplicating the application
database template you can find under `storage/app.db.template`. This
[SQLite][sqlite] database is used to store a temporary copy of the hydrus
server data in an optimized form (for faster on-demand querying). It also holds
users and tokens for authentication. The default (and recommended) location of
the database is `storage/app.db`, but you are free to put it wherever you want
and can rename it to your liking.

Next, you also need to duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`. This file is used to
configure hydrusrv and needs to be located in the root directory of the
application.

After copying it, you can edit `.env` and change hydrusrv's configuration. The
following are all the available settings (along with their default values):

+ `NODE_ENV=development`: defines the environment hydrusrv is running in.
  It currently does not affect anything besides the logging but it should be
  set to `production` in a live environment and `development` when developing.
+ `URL=https://example.com`: the URL under which hydrusrv is accessible. Used
  to generate correct media paths. __No trailing slashes.__
+ `PORT=8000`: the port hydrusrv is listening on. This can be different than
  the port used to access it from outside when proxying via [nginx][nginx]
  (recommended) or similar solutions.
+ `API_BASE=/api`: the base path of all the API routes. __No trailing__
  __slashes.__
+ `MEDIA_BASE=/media`: the base path of all the media routes. __No trailing__
  __slashes.__
+ `APP_DB_PATH=./storage/app.db`: the application database path (absolute or
  relative). The database must exist and the file must be read-/writeable for
  hydrusrv.
+ `REGISTRATION_ENABLED=true`: setting this to `false` disables the creation of
  new users.
+ `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH=16`: sets the minimum password length when creating or
  updating users. Providing a higher value than `1024` will discard the value
  and use `1024` as the minimum length instead.
+ `DATA_UPDATE_INTERVAL=3600`: sets the interval (in seconds) at which hydrusrv
  should sync its data with hydrus server (after the initial sync when starting
  hydrusrv). Updates are locked, so it is not possible to set this value too
  low â€“ the minimum time between updates will always be the time it takes to
  complete the update.
+ `FILES_PER_PAGE=42`: the results per page when listing files.
+ `TAGS_PER_PAGE=42`: the results per page when listing tags.
+ `LOGGING_ENABLED=false`: setting this to `false` disables access logging when
  `NODE_ENV=production` is set.
+ `OVERRIDE_LOGFILE_PATH=`: overrides the default logfile location
  (`logs/access.log`. Logging to a file is only enabled with
  `LOGGING_ENABLED=true` and `NODE_ENV=production`. With
  `NODE_ENV=development`, hydrusrv logs to the console instead.
  __Absolute path required.__
+ `ALLOW_CROSS_DOMAIN=false`: allows cross-domain requests (useful when the
  application accessing the API is located on a different domain).
+ `HYDRUS_SERVER_DB_PATH=`: sets the path to the hydrus server main database
  (called `server.db`). __Absolute path required.__
+ `HYDRUS_MASTER_DB_PATH=`: sets the path to the hydrus server master database
  (called `server.master.db`). __Absolute path required.__
+ `HYDRUS_MAPPINGS_DB_PATH=`: sets the path to the hydrus server mappings
  database (called `server.mappings.db`). __Absolute path required.__
+ `HYDRUS_FILES_PATH=`: sets the path to the hydrus server files directory
  (called `server_files`).  __Absolute path required.__
+ `HYDRUS_TAG_REPOSITORY=2`: the ID of the hydrus server tag repository
  hydrusrv should use.
+ `HYDRUS_FILE_REPOSITORY=3`: the ID of the hydrus server file repository
  hydrusrv should use.
+ `HYDRUS_SUPPORTED_MIME_TYPES=1,2,3,4,9,14,18,20,21,23,25,26,27`: the IDs of
  the MIME types hydrusrv should support. See [here][supported-mime-types] for
  the complete list of MIME types hydrusrv can handle.

After you are done making adjustments, make sure `APP_DB_PATH` points to the
correct location and run migrations to finish setting up the database:

```zsh
user@local:hydrusrv$ yarn migrate
```

### Running the server

First of all, you have several options to start the server:

+ `yarn start-dev`: starts the server in development mode using
  [nodemon][nodemon] to watch for file changes and restarts when necessary.
+ `yarn start`: starts the server in production mode.
+ `./bin/www`: the script that is run when using both, `start-dev` and `start`.
  You can also execute it directly to start the server in production mode.

For running in production mode, you will likely want to set up both a reverse
proxy (I recommend [nginx][nginx]) and a way to autostart hydrusrv when booting
your machine (I personally use [Supervisor][supervisor]).

You can also deploy with [Docker][docker]. I have created
[another repository][hydrusrv-docker] that shows you how to run hydrus server
and hydrusrv together using [Docker Compose][docker-compose] in a
production-ready example.

When running in production mode, I highly recommend using HTTP/2.

### API

hydrusrv provides a REST-like API that a client can connect to to request data
from the server. Such a client could for example be a simple script that
"syncs" the media of a hydrus server installation with your local machine or an
application with a GUI that behaves like a booru (like
[hydrusrvue][hydrusrvue]).

#### General

Request and response bodies are always in JSON format (except when sending the
actual files). Single resources (e.g., a file or an actual media file) will
return an error with status code `404` when they do not exist while lists
(e.g., of tags or files) simply return an empty array when nothing is found.

#### Authentication

All the routes except the base route (`/api`), the ones for registering new
users and creating tokens and the ones returning the actual media files are
protected with a token-based authentication. In order to access these routes, a
valid token must be provided via an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

When updating or deleting users and tokens, the provided authentication token
is also used to identify which user/token(s) are to be modified/deleted.

Media files are protected with media tokens that are created alongside
authentication tokens. Such a media token must be provided as query parameter
when trying to access media files and expires alongside the authentication
token.

#### Errors

When a resource is not available or an issue occurs, hydrusrv will return one
of several possible errors which are always in the same format:

```json5
{
  "error": <error name>
}
```

hydrusrv responds after the first error occurs so multiple errors might have to
be dealt with one after another.

+ `InternalServerError`

##### Tags

###### Listing tags

__Route:__ `GET /api/tags?page=<page>&contains=<text>&sort=<method>&direction=<sort direction>`

The `contains` parameter is optional and limits the results to tags containing
the provided text.

The `sort` parameter is also optional and is used to sort the results by a
different field instead of `id` (which is the default sort method).

The available `sort` parameters are:

+ `id` (default, does not have to be provided): sorts descending by field `id`
+ `name`: sorts ascending by field `name`
+ `files`: sorts descending by field `file_count`
+ `contains`: sorts tags starting with the text provided via `contains`
  parameter and everything else ascending by field `name`
+ `random`: sorts randomly

The sort direction for most fields (except `random`) can be changed via
`direction=asc` and `direction=desc`.

__Output on success:__

```json5
[
  {
    "name": <name of the tag>
    "fileCount": <amount of files having the tag>
  }
  // [â€¦]
]
```

__Possible errors:__

+ `InvalidContainsParameterError`
+ `InvalidSortParameterError`
+ `InvalidDirectionParameterError`
+ `ShuttingDownError`
+ `InternalServerError`

###### Autocompleting tags

__Route:__ `POST /api/autocomplete-tag`

__Input:__

```json5
{
  "partialTag": <name of the partial tag>
}
```

__Output on success:__

```json5
[
  {
    "name": <name of the tag>,
    "fileCount": <amount of files having the tag>
  }
  // [â€¦]
]
```

__Possible errors:__

+ `MissingTokenError`
+ `InvalidTokenError`
+ `MissingPartialTagFieldError`
+ `InvalidPartialTagFieldError`
+ `ShuttingDownError`
+ `InternalServerError`

##### Files

###### Listing files

__Route:__ `GET /api/files?page=<page>&tags[]=<tag>&sort=<method>&direction=<sort direction>&namespaces[]=<namespace>`

__Info:__

The `tags[]` parameter is optional and takes an arbitrary amount of tags (a
single tag per `tag[]=`), each one limiting the result set further.

The `sort` parameter is also optional and is used to sort the results by a
different field instead of `id` (which is the default sort method).

The available `sort` parameters are:

+ `id` (default, does not have to be provided): sorts descending by field `id`
+ `size`: sorts descending by field `size`
+ `width`: sorts descending by field `width`
+ `height`: sorts descending by field `height`
+ `mime`: sorts ascending by field `mime`
+ `namespaces`: sorts ascending by provided namespaces first and ascending by
  field `id` second
+ `random`: sorts randomly

The sort direction for most fields (except `random`) can be changed via
`direction=asc` and `direction=desc`.

If `sort=namespaces` is set, at least one namespace must be provided via
`namespaces[]=<namespace>`. This then sorts the results  by that namespace
(e.g., files with tag `creator:a` come before `creator:b` if sorted by
`creator` and the default direction).

Providing multiple namespaces to sort by is possible, the order in which they
are provided then defines the "sub sorting". E.g.,
`sort=namespace&namespaces[]=<namespaceA>&namespaces[]=<namespaceB>&namespaces[]=<namespaceC>`
causes files to be sorted by `namespaceA`, then `namespaceB`, then
`namespaceC`.

Files not having one or more of the given sort namespaces are _not_ omitted
from the results but will be sorted descending by `id` to the end of the (sub)
set.

This route returns the same data for each file as when
[viewing a file](#viewing-files) but omits the tags to reduce the response size
when dealing with possible cases where many files that each have many tags are
displayed on a single page.

__Output on success:__

```json5
[
  {
    "id": <file ID>,
    "mime": <MIME type>,
    "size": <file size in bytes>,
    "width": <width in pixel>,
    "height": <height in pixel>,
    "mediaUrl": <original media URL>,
    "thumbnailUrl": <thumbnail URL>
  }
  // [â€¦]
]
```

__Possible errors:__

+ `MissingTokenError`
+ `InvalidTokenError`
+ `MissingPageParameterError`
+ `InvalidPageParameterError`
+ `InvalidTagsParameterError`
+ `InvalidSortParameterError`
+ `InvalidDirectionParameterError`
+ `MissingNamespacesParameterError`
+ `InvalidNamespacesParameterError`
+ `ShuttingDownError`
+ `InternalServerError`

###### Viewing files

__Route:__ `GET /api/files/<file id>`

__Info:__

This route returns the same data as when [listing files](#listing-files) but
also includes a files' tags.

__Output on success:__

```json5
[
  {
    "id": <file ID>,
    "mime": <MIME type>,
    "size": <file size in bytes>,
    "width": <width in pixel>,
    "height": <height in pixel>,
    "mediaUrl": <original media URL>,
    "thumbnailUrl": <thumbnail URL>,
    "tags": [
      {
        "name": <name of the tag>,
        "files": <amount of files having the tag>
      }
      // [â€¦]
    ]
  }
  // [â€¦]
]
```

## Demo

You can find a demo installation of [hydrusrvue][hydrusrvue] at
[https://hydrusrvue.mser.at][hydrusrvue-demo]. The hydrusrv API is available
under [https://hydrusrvue.mser.at/api][hydrusrvue-demo-api].

Please take note that I am running this installation using
[hydrusrv-docker][hydrusrv-docker] on a small
[Vultr Cloud Compute][vultr-cloud-compute] instance with limited performance,
bandwidth and traffic (meaning the demo could go down until the next month if
the traffic limit gets exceeded).

It contains only safe for work images tagged with `scenery` (take a look at the
[hydrusrvue screenshots][hydrusrvue-screenshots] for some examples).

Registration is enabled, so feel free to create as many users as you would
like. __Created users are deleted at 12am every day.__

## Caveats

hydrusrv was mainly developed for my personal use and might therefore lack some
features others might want to see. Some of these could be:

+ The user management is very basic. There are no roles, no rights and no way
  to delete a user other than using an access token that belongs to that user
  (aside from doing it directly via database of course).
+ hydrusrv __needs__ one tag and one file repository to work. Trying to run it
  without either will result in errors. It also cannot support additional
  repositories.
+ hydrusrv discards namespaces containing other characters than alphanumerics
  and underscores to not falsely assume emote tags like `>:)` have a namespace
  and to prevent errors (namespaces are used as column names and SQLite does
  not allow most characters aside from alphanumerics in those; mapping such
  special characters would have been possible, but did not seem worth the
  effort).
+ hydrus server supports many more MIME types than the ones I have limited
  hydrusrv to. This is due to the fact that determining the MIME type of a file
  is rather difficult in hydrus server and I wanted to keep it as simple as
  possible.
+ The available API routes are currently limited to what I personally need. I
  might expand these in the future (e.g., user listing, token listing etc.) but
  I am also happy to accept pull requests.

In addition, you might run into issues or limitations when using hydrusrv. Here
are the ones I am currently aware of:

+ When hydrusrv updates its copy of the hydrus server data, it does so without
  locking the database to prevent issues in hydrus server (which most likely
  does not expect another application to randomly lock the database when it is
  trying to write). The update can also take a while on larger databases, which
  might lead to hydrus server changing or adding data while hydrusrv is still
  in the update process. When this happens, hydrusrv _should_ not crash, but
  it will stick to the data it currently has and try again after the period set
  via `DATA_UPDATE_INTERVAL` has passed. This means that on a busy hydrus
  server installation, hydrusrv might not often find the time to complete an
  update. This can be somewhat alleviated by setting a shorter interval, but I
  still would not recommend running it on a public hydrus server installation
  where multiple users might add or change data at any moment in time.
+ hydrus client/server is updated frequently (usually once a week) and while I
  try to keep hydrusrv up-to-date with any database changes (that thankfully do
  not occur very frequently), I suggest keeping an old copy of hydrus server
  when updating in case anything breaks if you are "dependent" on hydrusrv
  working. In addition, please [let me know][issues-url] if that happens.
